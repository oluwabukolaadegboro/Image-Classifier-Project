# Image-Classifier-Project
**Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning.**

In this project, I used my knowledge of deep learning architectures to develop an Image Classifier using Pytorch deep learning framework. 

The project was in two parts. First, the deep neural network was built and trained on a flower dataset which contains over 100 categories. Then it was converted into a command line application. The application is a pair of Python scripts (train.py and predict.py) which runs from the command line.

During training, I modified the hyperparameters to suit my desired model. To this end, I did a bit of exploration before exploitation.

At end of this project, the trained network was able to recognize a wide range of flower species.
